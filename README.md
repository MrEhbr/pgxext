**pgxext** is a comprehensive collection of PostgreSQL extensions for the [pgx](https://github.com/jackc/pgx) v5 driver, designed to simplify database operations, cluster management, and testing workflows.

## Features

- **Cluster Management**: Primary-replica topology with automatic read/write routing
- **Enhanced Querying**: Simplified scanning with struct binding support
- **Transaction Management**: Advanced transaction handling with timeout controls
- **Testing Utilities**: Transaction-based testing for isolated test environments

## Installation

```bash
go get github.com/MrEhbr/pgxext
```

## Architecture

pgxext is organized into three main packages:

- **cluster/** - Primary-replica database abstraction
- **conn/** - Enhanced querying & transactions
- **txdb/** - Testing utilities

## Packages

### cluster - Primary-Replica Database Management

Abstracts primary-replica physical database topologies as a single logical database. Automatically routes reads to replicas and writes to primary with round-robin load balancing.

### conn - Enhanced Database Querying

Simplifies querying and scanning with automatic struct binding, transaction context management, and configurable timeouts.

### txdb - Transaction-Based Testing

Single transaction-based database wrapper for fast, isolated functional tests without database reloads.

## Quick Start

See the [`examples/`](examples/) directory for complete working examples:

- [`examples/cluster/`](examples/cluster/) - Primary-replica cluster usage
- [`examples/conn/`](examples/conn/) - Enhanced querying and transactions
- [`examples/txdb/`](examples/txdb/) - Testing with transaction isolation

## Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Set up test database
export PGXEXT_TEST_DATABASE_DSN="postgres://user:password@localhost:5432/testdb"

# Run tests with coverage
just test

# Start development database
just dev
```

### Integration Tests

Tests require a PostgreSQL database. If `PGXEXT_TEST_DATABASE_DSN` is not set, integration tests are automatically skipped.

## Development Commands

This project uses [Just](https://github.com/casey/just) as a command runner:

- `just test` - Run tests with race detection and coverage
- `just lint` - Run golangci-lint with comprehensive rules
- `just fmt` - Format code using golines and gofumpt
- `just dev` - Start development database
